## akka_sandbox
A place to play and test out skills related to Akka in Scala.

This is work that is based on some of the actor code used in the Lightbend course on Akka 
(https://www.lightbend.com/services/training/lightbend-akka-for-scala-professional)  
The main code used from the course example is the Terminal trait to parse input and the outline used by the driver 
object, in this case DataProcessorApp. The course itself was a very useful introduction to Akka and this repository does
not cover much of the learning that happens in that course.  The repo will also diverge more as I add to it.
